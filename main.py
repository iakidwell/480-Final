iakidwell â€” 04/21/2024 3:30 PM
awesome thank you
i'm so relieved to see the grading schema lol
dusty_ally â€” 04/21/2024 3:30 PM
Yeah the matrial is  too vast
iakidwell â€” 04/21/2024 3:30 PM
he isn't doing a great job of explaining it or contextualizing it
but that's okay
i am listening on 1.5x speed so maybe i'm loosing something lol
dusty_ally â€” 04/21/2024 3:30 PM
i guess preparing the homework and midterm exam would put us in a good shape
iakidwell â€” 04/21/2024 3:35 PM
i might use some PTO this week to make time to work on this final. but hopefully that can be avoided
dusty_ally â€” Yesterday at 11:42 AM
guys any idea on how to connect sql and python
i am trying to use vs code but failing to connect to the database
iakidwell â€” Yesterday at 12:42 PM
i can look into it slightyl later this afternoon
iakidwell â€” Yesterday at 4:18 PM
do we have a repository going?
iakidwell â€” Yesterday at 4:36 PM
I have an executive decision for this project if you guys are fine with it
we should use SQLite and avoid the server/client model and any complications that come with it
SQLite is preinstalled with python as well
I am building out the basics of the menu system. I will then turn to getting SQLite and the database set up
from there is should be pretty easy to divide and conquer: we can each take some functionalities off of the project rubrick and complete them
iakidwell â€” Yesterday at 5:10 PM
ok stepping away from the computer for now but I wanted to update you guys on progress. I made another repository because I didn't know where to put what I was working on otherwise. here is the link:
https://github.com/iakidwell/480-Final
GitHub
GitHub - iakidwell/480-Final: Application for the 480 Final project
Application for the 480 Final project. Contribute to iakidwell/480-Final development by creating an account on GitHub.
GitHub - iakidwell/480-Final: Application for the 480 Final project
Here is what I did:
create the loop and menu items for the librarians and clients (w/o functionality obviously)
implement SQLite and run our DDL script from phase 2 of the project. (see: createDB.py)
Remember: SQLite does not use the Server-Client model for database management, which means we side step any networking problems. Just a heads up.
When you guys get a chance could you review and give thoughts? I have a lot of time tomorrow to work on this project.
thank u!
dusty_ally â€” Yesterday at 8:08 PM
Yeah I already Uploaded the previous files
dusty_ally â€” Yesterday at 8:09 PM
so can we access the git with SQlite
dusty_ally â€” Yesterday at 9:24 PM
Alright I just forked
and connected to Vscode
I didn't knew Sqlite is this easy
But i have one question we have to make ourr project work according to PostgreSql right
Does Sqlite and Postgre both the same syntax ??
iakidwell â€” Yesterday at 9:47 PM
good catch
no we do not. postgres is not an explicit requirement according to the project page on the website
SQLite has very similar syntax to postgres with some small differences
how should we divide up the labor for this project?
i took work off tomorrow but i also need to prepare for the final
dusty_ally â€” Yesterday at 9:53 PM
I just the code
Of the library update delete methods
Good work
Iâ€™ll try working on the backend
iakidwell â€” Yesterday at 10:04 PM
okay. i will be very vocal about when i'm doing tasks so we don't double do work
dusty_ally â€” Yesterday at 10:14 PM
So when u work and pushing it to git comment your name and changes u pushed
So it would be easy for us to figure out if any mistake occurs to fix the particular problem
iakidwell â€” Yesterday at 10:15 PM
i am a total git noob
so if you have any more guidance i will happily adhere
dusty_ally â€” Yesterday at 10:16 PM
Ok Iâ€™ll send you some git commands for pushing and pulling
iakidwell â€” Yesterday at 10:16 PM
thank you!
dusty_ally â€” Today at 3:42 AM
Guys I made some changes to the code and push it to the git please check
Itâ€™s working for now
dusty_ally â€” Today at 9:00 AM
And guys before u start working on the donâ€™t forget to pull the data from git which I worked on. Then donâ€™t forget to push the data to git after u work
iakidwell â€” Today at 10:39 AM
how is that done?
dusty_ally â€” Today at 10:52 AM
Do you work on vs code ?
iakidwell â€” Today at 10:52 AM
yes
dusty_ally â€” Today at 10:53 AM
Alright then it is easy
iakidwell â€” Today at 11:05 AM
i'm working on the librarian functionalities rn
dusty_ally â€” Today at 11:06 AM
Did u pull the data from git ?
iakidwell â€” Today at 11:06 AM
no. how is that done?
what do you mean by data? total noob moment
dusty_ally â€” Today at 11:06 AM
So ur working on vs code u have to connect to git repository and pull the data
Iâ€™ll send one example video
iakidwell â€” Today at 11:07 AM
thank you!

This will help you
dusty_ally â€” Today at 11:10 AM
I worked on the library functionalities yesterday
iakidwell â€” Today at 11:10 AM
oh!
dusty_ally â€” Today at 11:10 AM
So I uploaded the work to git
iakidwell â€” Today at 11:10 AM
when you say the data, what are you referring to?
the work you did?
dusty_ally â€” Today at 11:10 AM
And you pull the work I did and can work on it
dusty_ally â€” Today at 11:10 AM
Yes ðŸ˜…
iakidwell â€” Today at 11:10 AM
ahhhh awesome
lololol
dusty_ally â€” Today at 11:10 AM
ðŸ˜…
iakidwell â€” Today at 11:11 AM
i'm gonna be a SWE in no time
ok what were you able to knock out?
also are either of you going to class in person today? i am
iakidwell â€” Today at 11:20 AM
i'm so sorry i'm not seeing where your work is on the github. when i pull nothing shows up.
are we talking about the same repo? "480-Final"
dusty_ally â€” Today at 11:22 AM
Yes one u created
iakidwell â€” Today at 11:23 AM
where on the github repository can i go to find your data?
dusty_ally â€” Today at 11:23 AM
If your not to pull the data
Open git and then download the files
And also can work it
iakidwell â€” Today at 11:24 AM
the files only contain the code i wrote yesterday
dusty_ally â€” Today at 11:25 AM
How many lines is the code?
It was somewhere around 420
iakidwell â€” Today at 11:25 AM
main.py is 168
dusty_ally â€” Today at 11:25 AM
Damn ðŸ¤¯
iakidwell â€” Today at 11:25 AM
yeah i don't see your stuff at all
ok so i'm not crazy lol
dusty_ally â€” Today at 11:25 AM
Just a sec
iakidwell â€” Today at 11:26 AM
kk
dusty_ally â€” Today at 11:26 AM
Iâ€™ll try sending here
iakidwell â€” Today at 11:28 AM
do you guys have any idea of how we should divide up the rest of the work? it seems super manageable if we're all accountable for a smaller chunk to implement
